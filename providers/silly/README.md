# The silly local virtual-kubelet provider

This is kinda useless, but it could become something fun! 

It's a very simple provider for the virtual-kubelet interface that (at least for now) simply keeps a list of its pods. It doesn't actually *do* anything when you create a pod on it other than keep it in a list. You can query the list of current pods on the virtual-kubelet node:

```
$ curl localhost:8080
[{"Name":"silly-pod"}]
```

## What's the point?

[I'm not sure!](https://medium.com/@lizrice/a-silly-virtual-kubelet-71b2ec466bc6) Maybe it's a way of exploring Kubernetes as a 'distributed operating system' that isn't necessarily just about running containerized code. Or maybe it's utterly pointless!
